# mdl_autoflow
An automation flow editor plugin for Moodle LMS.

# Idea

Moodle has everything needed to automate tasks for teachers, administrators and course managers. However, most plugins made for that purpose. Use code or restricted UI to control their tasks. With Node based editors and libraries becoming a common practice these days. We started this project to contribute back to this community.

# The Moodle Way

We love to stick to the Moodle way of doing things. That's why this plugin will be using the following:

- JavaScript: Language for the frontend. No TypeScript and no extra building steps.
- Retejs: For handling the node ui capabilities.

This list will be updated along with the development progress.

# For Other Systems?

For starter we are starting with Moodle. However, we are going to make it in a way we can move the frontend code to other system if that's possible. This section will be updated once we have a clear idea about the portability of this project.

# Contribute

You can, even though we don't have a clear roadmap for the project yet. It's just one guy working on it for the time being.

# Sponsor

This project is boostraped by DevLMS. It maybe open for sponsorship when needed.
